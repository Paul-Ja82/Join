        <h3>What is <span class="joinName">Join</span>?</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="joinName">Join</span> is a kanban-based project
          management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
          part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
          Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
          method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
          efficiency (or flow). <span class="joinName">Join</span> leverages the
          principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in
          an intuitive, visual interface. It is important to note that
          <span class="joinName">Join</span> is designed as an educational
          exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we
          strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
          guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other

              <h4>Deleting Cards</h4>

                Deleting Cards Once a task is completed, you can either move it
                to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will
                permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
                when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible. Remember
                that using <span class="joinName">Join</span> effectively
                requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the
